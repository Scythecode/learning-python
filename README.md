# learning-python
this is a mix of **my** solutions to the exercises from mooc.fi's python course, and also projects i've done in python while learning it. Nothing is in order, and the only completed exercises here are ones I wanted to do.

any projects i've done on my own will have bad code! im new to python and don't know much.

if you want to learn from this repo (for some reason), feel free to do so! just don't expect your code to look good :)
